# Multi-threading

A simple program written in Java demonstrating various threads being ran simultaneously to increment or decrement a value using synchronized methods.
The main thread sleeps for 20 seconds allowing the "child" threads to "work". These files are useful for reference as well as understanding how threads are implemented and used in java.
